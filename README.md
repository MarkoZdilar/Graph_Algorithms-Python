# Graph Algorithms - Python

Welcome to the Python project containing exercises from the Graph Algorithms course. This project consists of 7 exercises covering various aspects of graph algorithms.

## Graphical Representation of a Sample Graph

Here is an example of one of the graphs used in the exercises:

## Project Structure

This repository is organized in the 7 folders which contains the following exercises:

1. **Exercise 1:**
   - Warm-up tasks.

2. **Exercise 2:**
   - Rock-paper-scissors game with recursion.

3. **Exercise 3:**
   - Working with matrices and loading Pajek format into graph-friendly data structures.

4. **Exercise 4:**
   - Functions for converting graph representation to adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, and adjacency list.
   - Checking whether the loaded graph is Eulerian.

5. **Exercise 5:**
   - Finding Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** algorithms.

6. **Exercise 6:**
   - City traversal (graph node traversal) using brute-force, nearest neighbor algorithm, and sorted neighbor algorithm.

7. **Exercise 7:**
   - Finding shortest paths from one city to all others using **Dijkstra** and **Bellman-Ford** algorithms.
   - Finding the shortest path between two cities using **Greedy BFS** and **A*** algorithms.

## Running the Project

To run each exercise, simply open the corresponding Python in your favorite editor and execute it.
